  <h4>Answers to Section 7:</h4>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>You can check if apache is running by typing <font face="courier new">ps ax | grep httpd</font>.
    <li>The <font face="courier new">ServerRoot</font> variable indicates the directory which stores the server configuration, error, and log files. The <font face="courier new">DocumentRoot</font> variable indicates the directory from which resources can be requested from by a client.
    <li>The port is specified by the <font face="courier new">Listen</font> variable, which is currently set to 80.
    <li>The directory from which content is served is specified by the <font face="courier new">DocumentRoot</font> variable, which is currently set to /var/www/html/
    <li>TrafficLogs are stored in /var/log/httpd/access_log and ErrorLogs are stored in /var/log/httpd/error_log (since etc/httpd/logs is symbolically linked to /var/log/httpd/).
    <li>A directory index file is a file called index.html which should be placed in every directory under <font face="courier new">DocumentRoot</font>. This should be done since apache will return the index.html file from each directory when a client requests that specific directory.
    <li>To give each user their own webspace at /~user/ on an apache server, one needs to set the variable <font face="courier new">UserDir</font> to <font face="courier new">Enabled</font>. Then, creating a public_html folder in each user's directory will give them a directory under which they can place files to make up their webspace.
    <li>In order to make a password-protected directory, one must create a .htpasswd file to store the hashes of user passwords. A .htaccess file must then be created an placed in a secure location and the server must be configured to allow the server to ask for passwords when a directory with a .htpasswd file is requested by setting <font face="courier new">AllowOverride</font> to <font face="courier new">All</font>.
    <li>One can create error html files to display or can redirect a page upon encountering a server error by setting the appropriate <font face="courier new">ErrorDocument</font> variables.
    <li>A GET command simply requests for a specified resource from a server. POST is a way to send information to the server and request the server to do something with the sent data. HEAD is identical to GET, but only requests the response headers and not the entire response body.
